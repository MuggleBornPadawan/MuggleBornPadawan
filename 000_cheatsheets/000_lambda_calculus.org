#+title: lambda calculus
in the name of the alpha,
the beta, and the eta…
(λx.x x) (λx.x x)
* getting started
** λa.a
- λ - function signifier
- a - parameter variable
- a - return expression
** λ-calculus syntax
| expression | variable              | identifier  |
|            | expression expression | application |
|            | λ variable.expression | abstraction |
|            | (expression)          | grouping    |
- variable
  - x 
  - (a)
- applications
| f a     | f(a)       |
| f a b   | f(a)(b)    |
| (f a) b | (f(a)) (b) |
| f (a b) | f(a(b))    |
- abstractions
| λa.b      | a => b        |
| λa.b x    | a => b(x)     |
| λa.(b x)  | a => (b(x))   |
| (λa.b) x  | (a => b)(x)   |
| λa.λb.a   | a => b => a   |
| λa.(λb.a) | a => (b => a) |
** transformations
| property         | definition                    | initial state | final state | comment                                           |
| alpha conversion | renaming of bound variables   | λx.x+1        | λy.y+1      | avoid naming conflicts and to clarify expressions |
| beta reduction   | applying function to argument | (λx.x+1) 2    | (2+1)       | substituting the argument for bound variable      |
| eta conversion   | equivalent functions          | λx.(f x)      | f           | add or remove redundant lambda abstractions       |
- explore beta reduction - evaluation order, variable collision avoidance
- beta reduction - final state is beta normal form

| Bertrand Russel                   |    1910 | principia mathematica           | Russell's paradox - does set of all sets that do not contain themselves exist?           |

| Kurt Godel                        |    1931 | incompleteness theorem          | search for sufficient axioms - logical inconsistency - no way to prove or disprove       |

David Hilbert's decision problem is solved by Church in 1936 two months before Turing does - does solution exist? close to halting problem but not the same
