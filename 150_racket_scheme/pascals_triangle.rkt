;; 1.0 Core Recursive Function (Unmemoized)
;; ----------------------------------------
;; pascalTriangleElement-raw
;; Computes the element at a given row and column in Pascal's Triangle
;; using a recursive process. This is the pure, unmemoized definition
;; that directly implements the mathematical recurrence relation.
;;
;; This function is designed for clarity and adherence to the mathematical
;; definition, making it a perfect candidate for memoization to optimize.
;;
;; @param row An integer representing the row index (0-indexed).
;; @param col An integer representing the column index (0-indexed).
;; @return The integer value of the element at the specified row and column.
;;
;; Preconditions:
;; - row >= 0
;; - col >= 0
;; - col <= row (invalid inputs are handled defensively)
(provide printPascalTriangle)

(define (pascalTriangleElement-raw row col)
  (cond
    ;; Base Case 1: Elements at the very beginning (col 0) or the very end (col row)
    ;; of any row in Pascal's Triangle are always 1. These are the termination conditions
    ;; for the recursion.
    [(or (= col 0) (= col row)) 1]

    ;; Defensive Programming: Handle cases where the column index is mathematically
    ;; out of bounds for the given row. While the `printPascalTriangle` function
    ;; prevents this in normal operation, robust code anticipates unexpected inputs.
    [(> col row)
     (error 'pascalTriangleElement-raw "Column index (~a) cannot be greater than row index (~a) in Pascal's Triangle." col row)]

    ;; Recursive Step: The essence of Pascal's definition.
    ;; Each element is the sum of the two elements directly above it in the preceding row:
    ;; C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k).
    [else (+ (pascalTriangleElement-raw (- row 1) (- col 1))
             (pascalTriangleElement-raw (- row 1) col))]))


;; 2.0 Memoization Utility (Higher-Order Function)
;; ----------------------------------------------
;; memoize
;; This is a powerful functional programming pattern. `memoize` is a higher-order function
;; that takes another procedure (`proc`) as input and returns a *new* procedure.
;; This new procedure automatically caches the results of `proc` based on its arguments.
;; When the memoized procedure is called, it first checks its internal cache.
;; If the result for the given arguments is already stored, it returns it instantly (cache hit).
;; Otherwise, it calls the original `proc`, stores the result in the cache, and then returns it (cache miss).
;;
;; This pattern separates the core logic (pascalTriangleElement-raw) from the optimization (caching).
;;
;; @param proc The procedure (function) that you want to apply memoization to.
;; @return A new procedure that is a memoized version of the input 'proc'.
(define (memoize proc)
  ;; `let` creates a local binding for `cache`, ensuring each call to `memoize`
  ;; gets its own, fresh hash table. This is crucial for correctly clearing the cache
  ;; for each new triangle printing operation.
  (let ([cache (make-hash)])
    ;; Return a new lambda (anonymous function) that will be the memoized procedure.
    ;; This new function accepts any number of arguments (`args`).
    (lambda args
      ;; The list of arguments becomes the unique key for our cache.
      (let ([key args])
        ;; `hash-ref!` is a Racket function that performs a lookup.
        ;; If `key` exists in `cache`, its associated value is returned.
        ;; If `key` does NOT exist, the provided `thunk` (a procedure with no arguments)
        ;; is executed, its result is stored under `key` in `cache`, and then returned.
        (hash-ref! cache key
                   (lambda () (apply proc args))))))) ; `apply` calls `proc` with `args` as its arguments


;; 3.0 Main Function to Print Pascal's Triangle
;; ------------------------------------------
;; printPascalTriangle
;; This is the primary function that orchestrates the display of Pascal's Triangle.
;; It takes the desired number of rows as input and prints the triangle to the console.
;; Crucially, it leverages the `memoize` utility to create an optimized version of
;; `pascalTriangleElement` for its internal calculations, significantly speeding up
;; the process for larger triangles by avoiding redundant computations.
;;
;; @param numberOfRows An integer representing the total number of rows to print (0-indexed).
;;
;; Preconditions:
;; - numberOfRows must be a non-negative integer. Input validation is performed.
;;
;; Examples:
;; (printPascalTriangle 3)  ; Prints a 3-row triangle
;; (printPascalTriangle 7)  ; Prints a 7-row triangle
(define (printPascalTriangle numberOfRows)
  ;; Input Validation: Always ensure that inputs meet the function's requirements.
  ;; This makes the function robust and prevents unexpected behavior or crashes.
  (unless (and (integer? numberOfRows) (>= numberOfRows 0))
    (error 'printPascalTriangle "Number of rows must be a non-negative integer. Received: ~a" numberOfRows))

  ;; IMPORTANT: We create a *new*, memoized `pascalTriangleElement` function
  ;; for each call to `printPascalTriangle`. This ensures that the cache is
  ;; completely fresh for each triangle generation. If this were defined globally,
  ;; the cache from a previous call (e.g., for a 3-row triangle) would persist
  ;; and potentially interfere with a subsequent call (e.g., for a 7-row triangle).
  (let ([pascalTriangleElement (memoize pascalTriangleElement-raw)])

    ;; Outer loop: Iterates through each row, from row 0 up to (numberOfRows - 1).
    (for ([i (in-range numberOfRows)])
      ;; Indentation for centering the triangle.
      ;; This `printf` loop adds leading spaces. The formula `(* (- numberOfRows i 1) 2)`
      ;; dynamically calculates the number of spaces needed for rudimentary centering.
      ;; The multiplier (2) can be adjusted for visual spacing preference.
      (for ([s (in-range (* (- numberOfRows i 1) 2))])
        (printf " "))

      ;; Inner loop: Iterates through each column within the current row `i`,
      ;; from column 0 up to column `i`. A row `i` has `i + 1` elements.
      (for ([j (in-range (+ i 1))])
        ;; Calculate the value of the current element using our memoized function.
        ;; The result is then printed, followed by two spaces for clear separation
        ;; between numbers.
        (printf "~a  " (pascalTriangleElement i j)))

      ;; After all elements in the current row are printed, move to the next line
      ;; for the subsequent row of the triangle.
      (newline))))

;; 5.0 Conceptual Best Practices (Non-executable in this context)
;; -------------------------------------------------------------
;; --- Configuration Management and Environmental Variables (Conceptual) ---
;; For larger, more complex applications, parameters like the maximum
;; number of rows or caching strategies might be controlled externally.
;; Racket can access environment variables using `getenv`:
;; (define PASCAL_MAX_ROW (getenv "PASCAL_MAX_ROW"))
;; (define PASCAL_CACHE_ENABLED (string->boolean (getenv "PASCAL_CACHE_ENABLED")))

;; --- Robust Logging and Monitoring (Conceptual) ---
;; To observe the performance benefits of memoization (e.g., seeing cache hits vs. misses),
;; logging would be indispensable. Racket's `log` library could be integrated:
;; (require (lib "log.rkt"))
;; (define-logger pascal-logger)
;; (log-level pascal-logger 'debug)
;;
;; Example log within `memoize`:
;; (hash-ref! cache key
;;    (lambda ()
;;      (log-debug pascal-logger "Cache MISS for key: ~a. Computing..." key)
;;      (apply proc args)))
;; ; (log-debug pascal-logger "Cache HIT for key: ~a" key) would be implicitly returned
;; ; from hash-ref! if the key was found.
