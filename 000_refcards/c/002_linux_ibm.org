#+title: linux commands and shell scripting 
* intro
** os
*** intro
- manages hardware and resources
- allows interaction with hardware
- unix. eg: oracle solaris (open solaris), freebsd, hp-ux, ibm aix, apple macos
- linux - free and open source (foss), secure, multi-user, multi-tasking, portable

*** terminal overview
- shell - os level application that interprets commands. eg: bash, zsh
- terminal - appplication used to interact with shell  
** linux commands
- shell: getting information, navigating and working with files and directories, printing file and string contents, file compression and archiving​, performing network operations, monitoring performance and status of the system, its components and applications, and running batch jobs, such as etl operations
- basic: printenv SHELL, whoami, id, uname, ps, top, df, man, date
- file: cp, mv, rm, touch, chmod, wc, grep   
- navigation: ls, find, pwd, mkdir, cd, rmdir
- print: cat, more, head, tail, echo
- compression and archiving: tar, zip, unzip
  - archive and compress: tar -czf <destination.tar> <source>
  - decompress and extract: tar -xzf <fn> <destination>
  - zip (compress and bundle); tar (bundle and compress) 
- networking: hostname -s -i, ping, ifconfig, curl, wget (web get, download folders and files recursively) 
  - ip a
  - ip addr show <device> 
- informational: whoami, id -u -n, uname -s -r -v, df -h ~, ps -e, top -n 3, date "+%j day of %Y", date "+It's %A today"
- wrangling text files:
  - general: sort <fn>, sort -r <fn>, uniq <fn>
  - grep - i <pattern> <fn>
  - cut -c <a-b> <fn>, cut -d ' ' f2 <fn>
  - paste -d "," <fn1> <fn2> <fn3>
** shell scripting
- automate jobs: etl jobs, file backups and archiving, system administrative tasks
- shebang directive: #!interpreter [optional-arg]
