*** software engineer
- definition - software engineering is the application of scientific principles to the design and creation of software. The field uses a systematic approach to collect and analyze business requirements in order to design, build, and test software applications to satisfy those business requirements
- computer aided software engineering (case, 1980s) - business analysis and modeling, development tools, such as debugging environments, verification and validation tools, configuration management, metrics and measurement, and project management
- responsiblities - include design, build and maintain software systems. writing and testing code and consulting with stakeholders such as clients, third-party software vendors, security specialists, and other team members.
- developer (broad - structure)  vs engineer (narrow - specific)

** intro to software development
*** web and cloud development
- html, which defines the structure of the page, but doesn’t look very attractive - text, links, images / videos, page dividers, buttons 
- css, which adds style and flair to the page - provides front-end developers with a standard method to define, apply, and manage different sets of style characteristics for a website and each of its components. css ensures uniformity in look and feel, style, colors, fonts, designs, and layouts
- javascript, which adds interactivity and dynamic content - object oriented programming language
- static and dynamic (db, cms, php)
- new languages - syntactically awesome style sheets (sass), leaner style sheets
- js framework
  - built in tools like routing and form validation - angular.js (google) 
  - built and drop - react.js (facebook)
  - vue.js   
*** back end development
- creates and manages resources needed to respond to client requests. eg: login, authorization, search, payment 
- enables server infrastructure to process request, supply data and provide other services securely 
- apis, routing, and endpoints - image / info requests, forms (crud), input sensitive information 
- javascript (node.js, express), python (django, flask)
- structured query language (sql)
- object-relational mapping (orm)
*** pair programming
- same console or share screen virtually
- styles: driver / navigator, ping-pong, strong style 
*** applicatin development tools
- version control - git and github 
- libraries - collection of reusable code - eg: carousal, jQ (DOM manipullation), email validator, apache commons proper (java components)  
- frameworks - opinionated - standard way to build and deplouy applications - skeleton (add code) -  
  - angular js - dynamic web applications
  - vue.js - user interface focus 
- libraries allow you to call functions as and when required. framework defines the workflow that you must follow
- ci / cd - ci automatically builds and tests code; cd deploys changes 
- build tools - code to binaries for installation - downloading dependenceis, compile source code to binaries, packaging binary code, running tests, deployment to production
  - build automation utilities
  - built automation server
  - examples: webpack (js), babel (js compiler), webassembly (browser) 
- packages - make apps easy to install (app files, instructions, metadata) 
- package managers - checksum, download, update, manage
  - js (npm), java (gradle, maven), ruby (rubygems), python (pip, conda) 
*** software stack
- combination of tecnologies, stacked in heirarchy to support the application from user to computer hardware
- front-end technologies such as programming languages, frameworks, and user interface tools.
- back-end technologies such as programming languages, frameworks, web servers, app servers, operating systems, messaging applications, and databases
- technology stack is a broader term that includes hardware and infrastructure like virtual machines, containers, storage, and load balancers, as well as the software stack
- typical layers: presentation, business, and data. however, more complex applications use more complex stacks, which could include software for virtualization, scheduling and orchestration, runtime environments, database connectivity, networking, and security
*** ide
- explorer
- search
- source control
- debug - threads, call stack, variables, watch, breakpoints 
- extensions
- skills network toolbox - databases, big data, cloud, embeddable ai, other
** basics of programming
*** interpreted and compiled
- interpreted - javascript, python, html
- compiled - downloaded - os, java, c, c++, 
*** query and assembly programming languages
- high level lang - sql, pascal, puthon
- low level language - arm, mip, x86
- query language - crud - sql, aql, cql, datalog, dmx
*** code organization
- readablity, maintainablity, configuring
- pseudocode (larger projects)
  - informal, high level description
  - step by step sequence of solving a problem
- flowcharts (smaller projects) - microsoft visio , lucidchart, draw.io, drawanywhere 
  - pictorial representaion of algorithm, displays steps as boxes and arrows
  - designing or documenting a process or program
*** branching and looping
- boolean expfressions
- branching - execution control flow - if, if-then-else, switch, goto
- loop - while, for, do-while (executes at least once)
*** programming concept
- identifiers
  - reference program components - stored values, methods, interfaces, classes
  - special components: arrays (fixed size, sequential storage) and vectors (dynamic size) 
  - stores two types of data values - constants (eg: pi, person name) and variables
- functions and objects
  - functions - modular programming software development methodology - subroutines, procedures, methods or modules
    - standard libraires (built in) and user defined functinos
    - create, invoke, declare (s0me programing languages)
  - objects - object oriented programming - properties (attributes) and procedures (methods) 
** software architecture, design and patterns
*** introduction
- component interaction, operating environment, design principles, cost of revisions, non functional req
- artifacts: software design document (sdd), architectural diagrams, unified modeling language (uml)
- software design document - tech specs - assumptions, dependencies, constraints, requirements, objectives and methodologies 
- architectural diagrams - compoenents, interaction, constraints, confines, architectural patterns 
- production environment infrastructure decisions - servers, load balancers and databases 
*** software design and modeling
- document structural components and behavioural attributes using diagrams, flowcharts and uml 
- structured design vs behavioural models
  - structured design - modules and submodules - cohesive and loosely coupled
  - behavioural models - what; not how
- unified modeling language - visual representaiton to communicate architecture, design and implementation
- purpose of interaction and state transition diagram
*** object oriented analysis and design (ooad) 
- classes and objects
  - class is a blue print of an object - properties (data) and methods (actions) 
  - object - instance of class 
- class diagram
  [[file:/test/z_class_diagram.jpeg]]
- object oriented design in relation to software architecture 
*** architecctural patterns
- peer to peer, microservices, event driven, two-tier and three-tier, model-view-controller, blackboard, message broker, pipe-filter, controller-responder
*** application architecture 
- component based and service oriented architecture - characteristics
- component
  - component - individual unit of encapsulated functionality
  - char'c: reusable, replaceable, independent, extensible, encapsulated, non-context specific
  - eg: api, data access object, controller
- services
  - designed to be deployed independently and reused by multiple systems - loosely coupled and supports distributed systems 
  - has one unique, always running instance with whom multiple clients communicate 
  - eg: check credit rating, calc emi, process mortgage application 
- application implementation layers: object / class layer > component layer > service layer  
- distributed system - characteristics
  - multiple services located on different machines
  - services coordinate interactions via a communication protocol such as http
  - appears to the end user as a single coherant system 
  - char'c: share resources, fault-tolerant, multiple activities run concurrently, scalable, runs on a variety of computers, polyglot programming 
  - nodes: any device on a network that can recognize, process, and transmit data to other nodes on the network.

*** production deployment components
- components: presentation tier -> firewall -> web server / load balancer -> application server / proxy -> data server / high availablity data replica 
- firewall is a security device that monitors traffic between networks
- load balancer distributes network traffic amongst servers
- web server delivers content such as web pages, files, images, and videos to a client
- application server runs business logic and provides the application to the client rather than the client running the app on their own machine
- database server stores and controls the flow of data through a database management system.
- proxy - load balancing, system optimization, caching, acting as a firewall, obscuring the source of the request, encryption, scanning for malware, and more. improve efficiency, privacy, and security of data flowing through a network
*** code of ethics - 8 principles
- developed by joint taqsk force: IEEE-CS and ACM
- public - safety, fairness, accessiblity, integrity 
- client / employer - honest and forethright, seek consent when necessary, honor confidentiality 
- product - quality, cost and timeline
- judgement - maintain objectivity and honesty, no inappropriiate financial activity, no conflict of interest 
- management - minimize risk, employ security procedures, ensure realistic expectations, just compensation, ip rights 
- profession - comply with code of ethics, express concern over violations 
- colleagues - do not take credit for work of others; ensure others comply 
- self - quality software, conduct professionally
