backend
1. data structures & algorithms -  caches, queues, heaps, indexes, bloom filters, rate limiters
2. operating systems fundamentals - processes vs threads, memory management, virtual memory, syscalls, file descriptors, scheduling
3. networking & distributed systems basics - tcp vs udp, http/1.1 vs http/2 vs http/3, dns, load balancing, retries, timeouts, backpressure
4. databases - postgres - indexes, query planners, mvcc, isolation levels, wal, replication. why nosql exists?
5. consistency, transactions & failure models - cap, consensus (raft/paxos at a conceptual level), idempotency, exactly-once vs at-least-once, saga patterns
6. a systems language - go?: concurrency, networking, cloud-native systems. rust: safety, performance, correctness
7. concurrency & parallelism - thread pools, async runtimes, event loops, actor models, work queues
8. observability & production debugging - metrics, logs, traces, slos, alerting, profiling; debug memory leaks, latency spikes, and cascading failures
9. cloud & infrastructure fundamentals - containers, kubernetes basics, autoscaling, service discovery, ci/cd
10. security fundamentals - authn vs authz, tls, secrets management, common attack vectors, threat modeling
