#+title: web server
* general
** network protocols
- http, http3 (quic), https, web socket, tcp, udp, smtp, ftp
** distributed system patterns
- ambassador, circuit breaker, CQRS, event sourcing, leader election, publisher / subscriber, sharding
** cache systems
- kafka, redis, elastic
** message queue
- pulsar (all in one), rabbitmq (message broker), kafka (event streaming), IBM? (messaging middleware)
** data structures
- list, array, stack, queue, heap, tree, suffix tree, graph, r-tree, hash table
** load balancing algorithms
- round robin, sticky round robin, weighted round robin, ip / url hash, least connections, least time, geographic, session persistance, response time, dynamic ratio 
** system design
- algorithms - consistent hashing, geohash, quad tree, leaky bucket, token bucket, trie, bloom filter, raft / paxos
* introduction 
- load balancing software distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to improve responsiveness, reliability, and scalability.
- utilities: reverse proxy, content cache, load balancer, TCP/UDP proxy server, mail proxy server, api gateway 
** types of load balancing software
- hardware-based (e.g., F5, Cisco)
- software-based (e.g., HAProxy, NGINX)
- cloud-based (e.g., AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancing)
- virtualized (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox)
