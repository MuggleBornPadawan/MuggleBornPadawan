* introduction
** core dump
- program vs process
- memory: stack, heap, data and text
** developer productivity
- space metrics - https://getdx.com/blog/space-metrics/ - satisfaction and well-being, performance, activity, communication and collaboration, efficiency and flow
- devops research and assessment (dora) group - deployment frequency (df), lead time for changes (lt4c), mean time to recover (mttr), change failure rate (cfr)

| scalability           | requests per second (rps), cpu/memory utilization %, latency @ n users                   | kubernetes, docker, openstack                                            |
| availability          | uptime % (e.g., 99.99%), mtbf (mean time between failures), mttr (mean time to recovery) | kubernetes, haproxy, keepalived                                          |
| latency vs throughput | latency (p50, p95, p99 in ms), throughput (rps, tps)                                     | nginx, envoy, netty                                                      |
| data consistency      | replication lag (seconds/ms), consistency models (strong, eventual)                      | postgresql (strong), cassandra (eventual), zookeeper (coordination)      |
| caching               | cache hit ratio %, cache miss rate %, latency of cache lookups                           | redis, memcached, varnish                                                |
| database modeling     | query execution time (ms), index hit rate %                                              | postgresql (relational), mongodb (document), mysql                       |
| load balancing        | request distribution per node, cpu/memory load per node, active connections              | nginx, haproxy, envoy proxy                                              |
| failover & redundancy | mttr (mean time to recovery), failover success rate %                                    | kubernetes, patroni (for postgresql), pacemaker                          |
| security              | vulnerabilities found/patched, mttd/mttr for incidents, auth error rates                 | hashicorp vault, owasp zap, openssl, keycloak                            |
| observability         | the "four golden signals": latency, traffic, errors, saturation                          | prometheus, grafana, jaeger, elk stack (elasticsearch, logstash, kibana) |
| idempotency           | duplicate transaction/event count, error rate on retried requests                        | rabbitmq, kafka, stripe api (as an implementation example)               |
