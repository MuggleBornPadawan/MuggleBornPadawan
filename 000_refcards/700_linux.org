* linux
** security
- firewall - ufw?
- ssh - fail2b
- iptables 
- apparmour
- selinux
- sudo - restrict root access to users
- ssh hardening
- audit logging
- users / groups / owners - archaic
- permissions
- zero trust architecture - lease possible permissions at every level - user based and device based (not netwrok based)
** uncomplicated firewall (ufw)
*** deny by default and allow by exception
- port 20 and 21 - ftp
- port 22 - secure shell
- port 23 - telnet
- port 25 - smtp (simple mail transfer protocol)
- port 53 - domain name system
- port 67 & 68 - dynamic host configuration protocol 
- port 80 - http
- port 110 - pop3 (post office protocol version3)
- port 123 - network time protocol
- port 137, 138, 139 - NetBIOS, SMB
- port 143 - imap (internet message access protocol)
- port 443 - https
- port 445 - server message block (smb)
*** internal ports 
- port 5432 - postgresql
- application layer or ssh access recommended
- vpn access or ssl / tls or restricted firewall methods are not so secure
- DO NOT EXPOSE directly
*** general
- sudo ufw app list - script to be written to get the corresponding ports and display it in "security" alias

** general intro
zoxide, fd, tmux, gh cli, fzf, ripgrep, stow, jq, password-store, doppler cli
linux is a kernel which helps you interact with hardware and software
- shell - command line interface 
- terminal 
- file system directory 
- root (super user)
- permissions (rwx)
- process (pid)
- init - systemd
- daemons - sshd or cron
- pkg mgrs

- shell scripts
- environment variables ($path)
- pipes
- redirection
- standard streams (stdin stdout stderr)
- symbolic links (shortcuts)
- hard links (alternate names)
- mounting (storage)
- swap space
- cron jobs (schedule)

*** notes
- inotifywait is a linux command-line tool that monitors file system events using the inotify kernel subsystem. It allows you to track events like file access, modification, creation, deletion, and movement. key options include -m (monitor continuously), -r (recursive monitoring), -e (specify events), -q (quiet output), --timefmt (customize time format), and --format (customize output format). You can use it to automate tasks, monitor logs, trigger actions on file changes, and build file synchronization tools by outputting event details to standard output, which can then be piped to other commands for processing.
- ```socat``` is a versatile command-line tool for bidirectional data transfer between various address types, including TCP/UDP sockets, Unix domain sockets, files, serial lines, and SSL/TLS connections. It enables network relaying, serial communication, proxying, data transfer, debugging, and secure communication, offering greater flexibility and power than ```netcat```.
