#+title: code review
* introduction
** getting started
- familiarize yourself with the project's goals, requirements, user stories, ticket details and coding standards
- understand the code's context, fit with larger context and functionality
- set aside biases and focus on providing constructive feedback
** checklist
- typical errors - off-by-one errors, null pointer exceptions, or incorrect logic, edge cases, algorithms, loops, data set size (memory)
- readablity - variable names and comments, indentation and formatting, well structured code
- syntax and semantics - logical flow and error handling, language standards 
- performance - efficiency and optimization, resource management (cpu, memory), bottleneck
- security - input validation and sensitization, secure data storage and transmission, authentication and authorization
- testablity - unit tests and integration tests, code coverage and testing strategy, test driven development
- maintainablity - modularity and seperation of concerns, reusablity and refactorablity, documentation and commenting
** tools
- github, gitlab, crucible, gerrit, bitbucket
- pro tip: check compatiblity with source (version) control management
