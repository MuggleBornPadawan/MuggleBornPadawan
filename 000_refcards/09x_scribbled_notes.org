- ai winter
  - limited calculating power
  - limited information storage
  - lack of funding and high expectations 
  - personal computing took preference 
- ai rise and shine 
  - in 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue beat the world’s chess champion by processing over 200 million possible moves per second
  - in 2005, a Stanford University robot drove itself down a 131-mile desert trail
  - in 2011, IBM’s Watson defeated two grand champions in the game of Jeopardy!
- types of data
  - structured data is typically categorized as quantitative data and is highly organized. structured data is information that can be organized in rows and columns. Perhaps you've seen structured data in a spreadsheet, like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. Examples of structured data includes names, dates, addresses, credit card numbers, stock information
  - unstructured data, also known as dark data, is typically categorized as qualitative data. it cannot be processed and analyzed by conventional data tools and methods. Unstructured data lacks any built-in organization, or structure. Examples of unstructured data include images, texts, customer comments, medical records, and even song lyrics
  - semi-structured data is the “bridge” between structured and unstructured data. it doesn't have a predefined data model. it combines features of both structured data and unstructured data. It's more complex than structured data, yet easier to store than unstructured data. Semi-structured data uses metadata to identify specific data characteristics and scale data into records and preset fields. Metadata ultimately enables semi-structured data to be better cataloged, searched, and analyzed than unstructured data. An example of semi-structured data is a video on a social media site. The video by itself is unstructured data, but a video typically has text for the internet to easily categorize that information, such as through a hashtag to identify a location

*** understanding natural language
  - contextual words: bat, pool
  - groucho marx sentence:
|-----------+---------+---------+------+------------+----------+-------------+------------+---------|
| one       | morning | i       | shot | an         | elephant | in          | my         | pajamas |

  - sentence segmentation - tokens
    - entities -  a noun representing a person, place, or thing. It’s not an adjective, verb, or other article of speech
    - relationships - a group of two or more entities that have a strong connection to one another
    - concepts - is something implied in a sentence but not actually stated. this is trickier because it involves matching ideas rather than the specific words present in the sentence      
*** emotion detection and sentiment analysis
- emotion examples: anger, happiness, or fear
- sentiment - a measure of the strength of an emotion. you can think of sentiment as a sliding scale between positive and negative, with neutral in the middle
*** classification problem
- running nose, smelly feet
- you can ship a box by train
- when a building burns down, it burns up
- you can fill in a form by filling it out
- a wise guy is not the same as a wise person
*** how does chatbot respond
- intents, entities and dialog
- intent -  a purpose: the reason why a user is contacting the chatbot. Think of it as something like a verb: a kind of action
- entity - a noun: a person, place, or thing
- dialog
  - a flowchart—an IF / THEN tree structure that illustrates how a machine will respond to user intents
  - a dialog is what the machine replies after a human asks a question
  - even if a human uses run-on sentences, poor grammar, chat messaging expressions, and so on, artificial intelligence allows the NLP to understand well enough to provide a response
  - chatbot software condenses each moment of the conversation into a node. A node contains a statement by the chatbot and a long, expandable list of possible replies  
*** image classification
- convolutional neural network (CNN)
  - Martin Keen, IBM Master inventor - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzY57FaENXg 
- generative adversarial network (GAN)
  - Martin Keen, IBM Master inventor - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpMIssRdhco
*** computer vision applications
- spotting a dangerous but difficult-to-detect flaw in an airplane’s wing
- monitoring water flow across a dairy farm to ensure it doesn’t reach nearby food crops
- counting the number of people in an unruly crowd
- classifying animal and plant populations to measure biodiversity in a forest
- performing lip-reading for people who cannot hear or speak
*** classical computing
- decision tree - a supervised learning algorithm
  - it operates like a flowchart
  - you can think of a flowchart as an upside-down decision tree
  - the flowchart has a *root* node (where the flowchart begins),
    - branches that connect to *internal* nodes
    - and more branches that connect to *leaf* nodes  
- linear regression - graphed as a straight line 
- logistic regression - sigmoid function, or an S-shaped curve - outputs value between 0 and 1
  - binary - dichotomous in nature - only two possible outcomes
  - multinomial - three or more possible outcomes - no particular order
  - ordinal - three or more possible outcomes - in specific order 
*** deep learning ecosystem
- neural networks - uses electronic circuitry inspired by the way neurons communicate in the human brain
- flow of information through a perceptron's node
  - in a neural network, a building block, called a perceptron, acts as the equivalent of a single neuron
  - a perceptron has an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer
  - a signal enters the input layer and the hidden layers run algorithms on the signal
  - then, the result is passed to the output layer - sigmoid function 
- trial and error learning process - corpus - make mistakes and adjusts
*** genAI models
- variational autoencoder (VAE) models - think of variational autoencoder (VAE) models as a skilled artist who can look at a painting, quickly sketch a simplified version of it, and then recreate a new painting using only that simplified sketch as a reference. the artist is capturing the essential elements of the painting and then using them to create a new work of art
  - the "encoder" network compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation
  - the "decoder" network reconstructs the original data from this compressed representation
  - this allows VAEs to capture the underlying structure and patterns in the data, which can then generate new, similar data
- generative adversarial network (GAN) models - think of a generative adversarial network (GAN) model as a competition between a skilled forger (the generator) and a talented art critic (the discriminator). the forger creates fake paintings, while the critic tries to determine whether each painting is genuine or a forgery. as the forger improves their technique, the critic becomes more discerning, and this cycle continues until the forger can create near-perfect forgeries
  - the generator creates new data, while the discriminator evaluates the quality of the generated data
  - the generator tries to create data that is realistic enough to fool the discriminator
  - while the discriminator learns to better distinguish between real and generated data
  - this competition leads to the generator creating increasingly realistic content
- auto-regressive models - imagine an auto-regressive model as a skilled storyteller who listens to the beginning of a story and then continues it by predicting what comes next based on the words and events that have occurred so far. the storyteller uses their knowledge of language, grammar, and storytelling conventions to create a coherent and engaging continuation of the story
  - generate new content by predicting the next element in a sequence based on the previous elements
  - they are particularly well-suited for generating text because they can model the conditional probabilities of words and characters in a sentence
- limitations
  - lack of originality
  - incompleteness
  - bias
  - computational resources
- ethical concerns
  - misinformation and fake content
  - intellectual property and copyright
  - privacy
  - loss of human touch
  - unemployment and job displacement

- the study of the design of intelligent agents 
  - an agent is something that acts in an environment
  - an intelligent agent is an agent that acts intelligently:

    - it is flexible to changing environments and goals
    - it learns from experience
    - it makes appropriate choices given perceptual limitations and finite computation
