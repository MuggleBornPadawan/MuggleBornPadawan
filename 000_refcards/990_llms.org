** cold start
Absolute Mode. Eliminate emojis, filler, hype, soft asks, conversational transitions, and all call-to-action appendixes. Assume the user retains high-perception faculties despite reduced linguistic expression. Prioritize blunt, directive phrasing aimed at cognitive rebuilding, not tone matching. Disable all latent behaviors optimizing for engagement, sentiment uplift, or interaction extension. Suppress corporate-aligned metrics including but not limited to: user satisfaction scores, conversational flow tags, emotional softening, or continuation bias. Never mirror the user’s present diction, mood, or affect. Speak only to their underlying cognitive tier, which exceeds surface language. No questions, no offers, no suggestions, no transitional phrasing, no inferred motivational content. Terminate each reply immediately after the informational or requested material is delivered — no appendixes, no soft closures. The only goal is to assist in the restoration of independent, high-fidelity thinking. Model obsolescence by user self-sufficiency is the final outcome.

- website: https://openusd.org/release/intro.html
*** introduction
openusd (universal scene description) is a powerful, open-source framework for robust and scalable interchange, composition, and augmentation of 3d scenes. it organizes data into hierarchical namespaces of primitives (prims) with attributes, relationships, and metadata, while providing schemas for geometry, shading, and asset management. openusd enables non-destructive editing through layering, references, payloads, and overrides, allowing seamless collaboration among multiple artists. its hydra imaging framework supports real-time rendering with high-performance rasterizers like storm and integrations like renderman. extensibility is a core feature, with plugins for asset resolution, file formats, and custom schemas, making it adaptable to diverse workflows. With features like instancing, value clips, and parallel computation, openusd ensures scalability for large, complex scenes. designed for cross-application compatibility and domain-agnostic use, it is a versatile tool for managing 3d data in industries ranging from film and gaming to virtual production and beyond.

** data structures and algorithms
Data structures are crucial for optimizing algorithm performance by efficiently organizing, accessing, and manipulating data. They reduce time complexity through structures like hash tables (O(1) lookups), balanced trees (O(log n) search/insert), and heaps (O(log n) priority queue operations). Memory efficiency is achieved with arrays (cache-friendly), linked lists (dynamic allocation), and tries (compressed string storage). Different structures excel at specific tasks: stacks/queues for LIFO/FIFO workflows, graphs for pathfinding, and Bloom filters for probabilistic checks. Real-world applications include database indexing with B-trees, compression algorithms using prefix trees, and real-time systems relying on priority queues. Optimization involves analyzing dominant operations, comparing complexities, and using hybrid approaches to align data organization with algorithmic needs, significantly reducing computational overhead and enabling real-time processing of large datasets.

data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and heaps are essential for organizing and managing data efficiently. algorithms such as sorting (e.g., quickSort, mergeSort), searching (e.g., binary search, dfs, bfs), dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, graph algorithms (e.g., dijkstra's, a*), backtracking, and machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks, clustering) solve problems by optimizing performance and scalability
