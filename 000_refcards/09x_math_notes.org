** dictionary
All of math can be described in four categories:
- primitive concepts - mathematical object that has no definition (eg: point, line, plane and set). we simply accept that they exist. explanation of concept is possible but proper definition cannot be constructed. 
- definitions - act of naming mathematical objects or relationship between objects
- axioms (postulates) - simply accepted without demonstration 
- theorems - mathematical sentence obtained through demonstration (logical deduction). eg: pythogroraz theorm
- forumula - Every formula is a theorem - has to be demonstrated 
- property - a fundamental characteristic or quality of a mathematical object, nuber or operation that remains consistent under specific conditions 
- lemma - result used to demonstrate a theorem 
- corolloary - result that follows immediately and directly from a theorem
- law - constant relationship between elements that can vary
