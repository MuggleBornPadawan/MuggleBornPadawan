*** Insert and Modify

- TAB or S-TAB – Move to the next or previous table cell.
- TAB jumps to the next cell.
- S-TAB (Shift + TAB) goes to the previous cell.
- M-x org-table-insert-column 
- RET – Insert a new row below the current row and move the cursor to the first cell of the new row.
- M-RET (Meta + RET) – Insert a new row or column. If the cursor is at the end of a row, it creates a new row. If it is at the end of a column, it creates a new column.
- | – Type this character at any place and it will start a table when followed by a TAB.

*** Resizing and Aligning
- C-c C-c – Align the table. This ensures that the columns are properly spaced.
- C-c TAB – Re-align the table based on its current structure. This is useful when you have manually modified content and want to fix the alignment.
- M-S-right/left – Move the current column to the right or left.
- M-S-up/down – Move the current row up or down.

*** Column and Row Operations
- C-c - – Insert a horizontal line separator below the current row.
- C-c C-w – Widen the current column.
- C-c C-n – Narrow the current column.
- M-right/left – Increase or decrease the width of the column under the cursor.
- C-c C-x M-w – Copy a region of a table to the kill ring (copy).
- C-c C-x M-y – Paste a previously copied region of a table.

*** Deleting Rows/Columns
- C-c C-d – Delete the current row.
- M-S-left/right – Delete the current column (or move it left/right).

*** Calculations and Formulas
- C-c = – Recalculate all formulas in the current table.
- C-c + – Insert a formula into the current table cell.
- C-c * – Recalculate the current cell (useful when working with tables that have numeric data).

*** Advanced Table Operations
- C-c ~ – Toggle the display of a table in spreadsheet mode, useful for complex calculations.
- C-c ^ – Sort the table. You will be prompted to enter the column and the type of sorting (numerical or alphabetical).
- C-c C-s – Split a table at the current point into two separate tables.

*** Creating a Table from Delimited Data
If you have data separated by spaces, commas, or tabs, you can easily convert it into an Org mode table.
- Select the text you want to convert.
- Press C-c | – This will convert the selected region into an Org mode table by detecting the delimiters.

*** Navigating Inside a Table
- TAB – Jump to the next field.
- S-TAB – Jump to the previous field.
- M-a – Move to the beginning of the table cell.
- M-e – Move to the end of the table cell.
